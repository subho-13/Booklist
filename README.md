# Liesel
Books are heaven -- For me.

And thus, I feel this inexplicable urge to have a perfect list. A list, imitating how we think - like a thread of thoughts - diverse, indulging and exhaustive. 
So, I built my own BookList Generator, I call Liesel (from "The Book Thief").

Now, Liesel wants to help you with your Booklist. Tell Liesel, your favourite book in the comments below. She will present you - your Ultimate-Reading-List. And for maximum fun, follow the list Liesel made for you.
